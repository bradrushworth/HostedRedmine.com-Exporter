# HostedRedmine.com Exporter

These PHP scripts provide a mechanism to extract and export records from Redmine installations for individual users in a multi-user environment. The user logs into the web-based form, and then can download their user information and projects that they are a member of. Attachments stored in Amazon S3 are also included in the ZIP file. The database is exported in MySQL format. The scripts can also be run from the command line by supplying the user's database ID number.

The original installation can be found here:
